# Poverty, Pollution & Education Inequity: A Data-Driven Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between **poverty**, **air pollution (PM 2.5 exposure)**, **healthcare access**, and **educational inequality** in the United States. Using publicly available data, the analysis reveals how low-income communities—often non-white—are disproportionately affected by environmental and social disadvantages.

---

## Key Findings

- **Environmental Exposure**: Low-income households are more likely to live in areas with **high PM 2.5 concentrations**, increasing risks of respiratory and cardiovascular illness.
- **Healthcare Disparities**: Many individuals in poverty lack access to affordable healthcare, worsening health outcomes and compounding inequality.
- **Educational Barriers**: Children in these communities often face health-related learning obstacles and attend underfunded schools with varied teacher qualifications.
- **Systemic Inequality**: These challenges create a **cycle of poverty**, limiting upward mobility and reinforcing generational disparities.

## Hypothesis

> Poverty correlates with reduced access to clean environments, healthcare, and quality education.

This hypothesis was **supported** by the data, showing a clear intersection between income level, environmental risk, and opportunity access.

## Recommendations

- **Improve educational quality** in low-income areas by incentivizing experienced teachers.
- **Expand public healthcare programs** to include more low-income households.
- **Investigate sources of PM 2.5** pollution near underserved communities and enforce regulations.
- **Support policy reform** to address long-standing resource distribution gaps.
